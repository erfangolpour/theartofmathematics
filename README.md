## The Art of MAthematics

Welcome to "The Art of Mathematics". This project is  Before you move on, please take a moment to read the instructions:
  
* When you hover the mouse over a function in the preview panel, the corresponding function will be highlighted on the graph to help you easily find a function.
* Use the white arrows on the main picture to switch between the sets of functions. For now there are 2 sets available.
* Click on each function to see a more detailed discription about it. You can also gain information about a function by hovering over it.
* Even though the functions are all precisely calculated, the key points are <strong>NOT</strong> manually identified. There is a loop which goes through the domain of each function and determines 10 integral points at most (where x and y are both integers). Therefore, it is possible to encounter a function that has no key points.
